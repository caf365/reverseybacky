# Below C Level x86-64 Simulator

Below C Level (BCL) is a simulator for a subset of the x86-64 assembly language.
It is designed for students new to assembly programming and offers a simple
interface that focuses on key concepts.

## Requirements

### Command Line

Use the following command to direct Maven to compile BCL.

```

To run the simulator, use the following Maven command:
